# ssh-telegram-notifier
Small sshrc to notify logins to a telegram bot
## Scope
This script allow you to get notified on telegram everytime someone login to a server via ssh
## How it works
Every time an user login, /etc/ssh/sshrc is executed (see man ssh). This sshrc will curl a message to your custom bot with basic information about login.

## Setup
- Contact @BotFather and create a new bot.
- Write down your token and use it in variable TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
- Open the bot you created and start conversation
- Retrieve you chat id and use it in variable TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
```bash
curl --silent "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates" | jq .
```
- modify sshrc with TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
- copy it to /etc/ssh
```bash
cp sshrc /etc/ssh/sshrc
chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshrc
chmod 0755 /etc/ssh/sshrc
```
- if you are logged into server via ssh, leave the current shell open and test the script making a new login
- enjoy!
## Possible improvements
The sshrc can be read by every user on the system, exposing you telegram bot password.
It will be better if one can have a separate daemon running by a private user that accept an incoming message from sshrc and write to your bot.
